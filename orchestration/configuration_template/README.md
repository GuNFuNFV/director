there are several steps to configure the network functions deployed

first execute conjecture_data.py to configure the structure of the configuration

then template_generator.py to generate the template by specifying the remaining structure

then create_exp.py to create a folder for the experiment, specifying the form that needs to be filled out for the configuration

after all the form is filled out in admin_input, call filling_template.py to generate the configuration vectors for the deployment.
